            <span>All code must begin on the first line with "ATM" to specify that it is A Turing Machine code.</span><br>
            <span>Addtionally all code must end with "END" to specify the end.</span><br>
            <span>Comments may be made as the final part of any line, but may not be on a line by themselves.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>After the first line ("ATM") begins the configuration section, which is written as follows:</span><br>
            <span>Line 2) The name of the machine (if downloaded, the file will have this name as well)</span><br>
            <span class="parent">Line 3) The input alphabet, where each valid character is seperated from its nieghbor by a space.</span><br>
            <span class="tabbed">    Example) "0 1" would be line 3 for a machine accepting bitstrings as input.</span><br>
            <span class="parent">Line 4) The tape alphabet, where each valid character is seperated from its nieghbor by a space.</span><br>
            <span class="tabbed parent">    Exmaple) "0 1 _" would be line 4 for a machine able to read and write bitstrings and the blank character.</span><br>
            <span class="tabbed">--Note-- To include the blank character in the tape alphabet, use an underscore (_).</span><br>
            <span>Line 5) The number of tapes (n)</span><br>
            <span>Line(s) 6 through 5 + n) The number of tracks for tape n. The number of tracks needs to be specified for every tape.</span><br>
            <span>Line(s) 5 + n + 1 through 5 + 2n) The infinite directions (1 or 2 way) for tape n. The infinite directions needs to be specified for every tape.</span><br>
            <span>Line 5 + 2n + 1) The initial state of the machine, i.e. the state the machine will begin at when the run starts.</span><br>
            <span>Line 5 + 2n + 2) The accepting or final states of the machine.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Line 5 + 2n + 3 begins the transition function section.</span><br>
            <span>There can be any number of transition functions greater than or equal to 1.</span><br>
            <span>Transition functions are written in the form "[state to be in for this function to be called] [character to read for this function to be called] [new state into which transition] [new character to write] [direction to move tape head]"</span><br>
            <span>[character to read for this function to be called] and [new character to write] <b>need</b> to be characters of the tape alphabet</span><br>

           <span>To run the Turing Machine, enter any string of characters from the input alphabet into the text area labled "Input" (read about multiple input areas in the "Multitracking and Multitaping" section) and then press the "Run" button.</span><br>
           <span>The speed at which the machine runs can be controlled by the slider labed "Speed".</span><br>
           <span>Additionally, the machine may be rerun with the curent output by pressing the "Rerun With Current Output" button.</span><br>
           <span>Below the rerun button is the current state and recognized status of the input.</span><br>
           <span>The current state of the machine will be displayed and updated when the machine's state updates.</span><br>
           <span>When the machine halts, it will display the recognized status of the input.</span>
